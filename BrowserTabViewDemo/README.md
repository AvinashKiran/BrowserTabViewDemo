BrowserTabView

The BrowserTabView is a browser-style tabview controller like the Dolphin Browser,you can add or remove tab dynamically.Currently,it does not support dragging to switch position between tabs just like the Dolphin Browser.It gives you a overlapping-look tabview and displays the tabs by rendering images, so if you want to custom it, simply replace these images.
